# Original Code

This directory contains the code for the distribution of DeterFox this experiment has been conducted with. Please note that in order to keep the git repository small the code has not been copied into this directory. It has rather been added as  a [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and will therefore not be pulled automatically when pulling the repository. In case you want to clone the DeterFox distribution please issue the following commands:

    # git submodule init
    # git submodule update

These commands should check the DeterFox code out into the `code/originalcode/gecko-dev` directory.
